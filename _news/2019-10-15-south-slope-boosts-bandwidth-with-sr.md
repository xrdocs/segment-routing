excerpt: >-
  South Slope, a rural independent telecommunications cooperative, has deployed the Cisco NCS5500 series platform to meet growing capacity demands, using its existing network to deliver voice, data, and video services along with a variety of business ethernet and cellular backhaul services to its customers throughout eastern Iowa. 
  To facilitate the transition, increase the power of the underlying transport network, and reduce operational complexity, Cisco and South Slope created a converged solution based on the Cisco NCS5500 router series. South Slope has also deployed Cisco Segment Routing with Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Ethernet VPN (EVPN).
