title: Topology Independent LFA (TI-LFA) and uloop avoidance
pdf2txt: images/tutorials/0080-SR-TOI-SR_TI-LFA_v17_EXTERNAL.txt
excerpt: >-
  An introduction to the Topology Independent LFA and micro-loop (uloop) avoidance technology. See how Topology
  Independent LFA provides a simple, automatic, optimal and topology independent
  sub-50ms per-prefix protection to the network. Further, see what uloops are and how SR effectively prevents these uloops.

An introduction to the Topology Independent LFA and micro-loop (uloop) avoidance technology. See how Topology Independent LFA provides a simple, automatic, optimal and topology independent sub-50ms per-prefix protection to the network. Further, see how TI-LFA protects Segment Routing, LDP and eventually IP traffic, and learn how to verify TI-LFA using some examples.<br />
In the end, see what uloops are and how SR effectively prevents these uloops.
