Traditional service provider networks are often divided into different domains, implemented using different underlay technologies. This makes it difficult to implement end-to-end services. SDN and Segment Routing provides the ability to simplify and allow the same transport technology to be deployed across different network domains. 
  
Cisco VTS provides native virtual-machine manager (VMM) integration, allowing for the automated orchestration of services on the NCS5500 series. This allows homogenous capabilities to be delivered across the different domains. This demonstration showcases Cisco VTS’s capabilities in performing Central Office Fabric Orchestration using a Segment Routing based Underlay, including the provisioning of L2 EVPN and L3 MPLS VPN services.
