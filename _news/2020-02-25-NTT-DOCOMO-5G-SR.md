excerpt: >-
  NTT DOCOMO selected Cisco NCS routers and Segment Routing technology for network slicing to help optimize its 5G mobile backhaul in preparation for the commercial service.
  <br/>
  Mobile backhaul is the transport network that connects the 5G radio (in the cell tower) to the core network that feeds into the data centers. DOCOMO needed a blueprint for more cost effective transport to meet its future 5G base station facility plan capable of achieving 400 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) speeds.
