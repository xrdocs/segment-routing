excerpt: >-
  Today on the Packet Pushers Weekly Show we talk about control. Imagine being able to control every flow in  your data center in a granular way, and not just based on the best path your routing protocol decides or the random hashing your ECMP comes up with.
  How do you get beyond the forwarding we’re used to? By manipulating flows with modern tools. One such tool is IPv6 segment routing (SRv6).
  Cisco, along with network architects from Bell Canada and LinkedIn, discuss just how IPv6 Segment Routing makes the network programmable in this sponsored episode.
