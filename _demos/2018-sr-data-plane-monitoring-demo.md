Demonstration showcasing Segment Routing Data Plane Monitoring (SR-DPM) solution. SR-DPM is an LSP data-plane monitoring solution that provides highly scalable blackhole detection capability.
A node uses SR-DPM to test its own data plane for any traffic received from any incoming interface towards any ECMP path. SR-DPM uses existing MPLS OAM tools and leverages SR to enforce test traffic path.
SR-DPM can be used in Proactive and Reactive modes of operation. Jose Liste demonstrates it in this video.
