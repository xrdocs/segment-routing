title: Topology Independent LFA (TI-LFA)
excerpt: >-
  An introduction to the Topology Independent LFA technology. See how Topology
  Independent LFA provides a simple, automatic, optimal and topology independent
  sub-50ms per-prefix protection to the network. Further, see how TI-LFA
  protects Segment Routing, LDP and eventually IP traffic. In the end, learn how
  to verify TI-LFA using some examples.
