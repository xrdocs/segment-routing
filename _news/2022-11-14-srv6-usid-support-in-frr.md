excerpt: >-
  <p>The support for SRv6 uSID has been merged in FRR. 
  FRR has now full support of SRv6 uSID based L3VPN BGP services.
  It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 address families either using a separate SRv6 Service SID for each address family (End.DT4 and End.DT6) or using a single SRv6 Service SID (End.DT46) for both. </p>
  
  <p class="article-excerpt">
  The SRv6 uSID implementation in FRR has been developed by Carmine Scarpitta from the university of Rome tor Vergata.
