An introduction to the Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (SRTE) technology. See how SRTE provides a simple, automated, and scalable architecture to engineer traffic flows in a network. Further, see how XR Traffic Controller (XTC) (the IOS XR based Path Computation Element (PCE)) fits into this architecture. XTC provides scalable multi-domain SR-optimized path computation capabilities, including multi-domain path disjointness.
SRTE provides lots of functionality. It was designed with lead operators, along their use-cases.
