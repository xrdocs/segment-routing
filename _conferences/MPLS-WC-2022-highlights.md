The [**MPLS WC 2022**](<https://www.uppersideconferences.com/mpls-sdn-nfv/mplswc_2022_agenda_day_1.html>), April 2022 in Paris paid particular attention to SRv6: Technical Progress, Interop, and next steps. Moreover, an impressive set of service providers describe current deployments and introduce some exciting innovations.

This page highlights a selection of SRv6 topics presented at this conference, and several demos and innovations that have been announced at that time.

<br />

### Highlighted presentations:

<br />
#### [Rakuten: SRv6 uSID in deployment to deliver end-to-end 5G Network Slicing](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Amit-Dhamija)
_**Amit Dhamija** of Rakuten_
<br />
Introducing the SRv6 uSID deployment use-case for Mobile Backhaul (MBH) and network slicing services.

<br />
#### [Bell Canada: SRv6 Deployment – Service programming Reduces Cost](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Daniel-Bernier-Jesper-Eriksson)
_**Daniel Bernier** of Bell Canada and **Jesper Eriksson** of NoviFlow inc._
<br />
Showing how SRv6 and a P4 programmable switch fabric can reduce carrier network services costs by up to 90%, footprint by 75%, and power consumption by as much as 66% and thus facilitate a cost effective migration of latency sensitive applications to the network edge. Including actual network deployment experiences.

<br />
#### [Bell Canada: SRv6 uSID Deployment – Benefits of an SRv6 uSID Fabric](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Daniel-Voyer)
_**Daniel Voyer** of Bell Canada_
<br />
Motivation to migrate from SR-MPLS to SRv6 uSID. Reviewing the benefits of an SRv6 uSID fabric.

<br />
#### [Alibaba: Full stack SRv6 Deployment](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Yuanchao-Su)
_**Yuanchao Su** of Alibaba_
<br />
Unified SRv6 dataplane from socket to peering link leveraging SRv6's scalability, simplicity & programmability in all layers to provide predictable network services to every single application.

<br />
#### [Softbank: SRv6 Mobile User Plane (MUP)](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Satoru-Matsushima)
_**Satoru Matsushima** of SoftBank_
<br />
Introducing the Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane (SRv6 MUP) architecture.

<br />
#### [Cisco: SRv6 Technology Status and Deployment Update](/conferences/MPLS-WC-2022-Clarence-Filsfils)
_**Clarence Filsfils** of Cisco Systems_
<br />
Reviewing the IETF status, the latest deployments and introducing some exciting innovations.

<br />

### Demonstrations:
<br />
#### [SRv6 ultra-scale - Imposition of 26 SRv6 uSIDs at Linerate](/demos/26-usid-push-linerate)
An NCS 5700 acting as an SRv6 PE pushes 26 uSIDs at linerate.

<br />
#### [SRv6 Stateless slicing at Ultra-Scale](/demos/stateless-slicing)
Apply stateless and scalable network partitioning to realize 5G slicing in the network.

<br />
#### [BGP PIC Edge with SRv6 Summarization](/demos/upa)
ISIS Unreachable Prefix Announcement (UPA) enables using BGP Prefix Independent Convergence (BGP PIC) functionality while using prefix summarization. Combining fast restoration with ultra-scaling.

<br />
#### [Path Tracing](/path-tracing)
Path Tracing allows operator to deterministically detect ECMP paths. It is implemented in HW at linerate in the normal forwarding pipeline and provides an Ultra-MTU-Efficiency.
