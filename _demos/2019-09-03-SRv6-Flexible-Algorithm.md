Flexible algorithm is an IGP extension allowing to create logical views or slices inside a single IGP domain.
This video demonstrates the application of Flexible Algorithm to SRv6.
We also show Performance Measurement to dynamically measure the link delays that can be used in Flexible Algorithm.
L3VPN functionality automatically leverages the Flexible Algorithm paths, providing low-delay paths as an example.
