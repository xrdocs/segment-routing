This video demonstrates the collection of a Deterministic Demand Matrix in your network and the Automated Capacity Planning (ACP) service that helps network operators plan and optimize their network capacity to meet the ever-increasing demand for data.

In this video, we will demonstrate how the Deterministic Demand Matrix hardware counters enable ACP to provide a comprehensive solution to network capacity planning and optimization.

By automating the collection of the Deterministic Demand Matrix counters and analysis of the network capacity, network operators can ensure the stability and reliability of their networks by
* Anticipating common failures
* Optimizing your network resources
* Planning for capacity growth
* Avoiding potential network downtime
