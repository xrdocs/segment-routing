  It’s an exciting milestone for Cisco and our customer Czech Education and Scientific NETwork  (CESNET) who is the first national research and education network (NREN) to deploy Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) micro-segment (uSID) to simplify its network architecture. Being the first NREN to deploy SRv6 uSID demonstrates CESNET’s leadership as an innovative NREN operator in the Czech Republic.
