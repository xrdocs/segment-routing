**Bruce McDougall** (Systems Architect, Cisco Systems) presents "SRv6 Technology and Deployment Use-Cases" at NANOG 78.

The SRv6 network programming model was first presented at IETF in March 2017. During the last two years, the ecosystem around the technology has made tremendous and successful implementation, deployment and standardization efforts.

In this talk, we will present the SRv6 ecosystem, standardization progress and the available implementations, both open source and commercial.

Then we will delve into the SRv6 deployed use-cases from (Softbank, Iliad) and planned deployments.
