excerpt: >-
  Segment Routing with Flexble Algorithm (Flex-Algo) enables the router to assign a user-defined algorithm to the IGP that can be implemented dynamically and on demand.<br />
  In this blog, Mike DiVincenzo, Technical Solutions Architect MPLS/Segment Routing at WWT, decribes a selection of the possible use-cases of Flexible Algorithms in combination with dynamic delay measurement.
