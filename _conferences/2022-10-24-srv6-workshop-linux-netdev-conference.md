Ahmed Abdelsalam from Cisco together with Daniel Bernier (Bell Canada), Reshma Sudarshan (Intel), Stefano Salsano (University of Rome Tor Vergata), Andrea Mayer (University of Rome Tor Vergata), Carmine Scarpitta (University of Rome Tor Vergata) presented SRv6 Network Programming the Linux Netdev 0x16 conference.

In the workshop the speakers give an update on the SRv6 support in the Linux Kernel. They review the supported SRv6 features, and associated iproute2 extension, starting from kernel 4.10 up to now. Also, they provide an update on some new SRv6 features that we plan to contribute to the Linux Kernel. In addition, they review the supported SRv6 features in FRR along with some interesting SRv6 control plane features that we plan to submit to FRR. Moreover, they give an update on the SRv6 activities in Linux related open-source stacks such as SONiC and Cilium.
