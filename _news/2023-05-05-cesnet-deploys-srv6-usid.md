excerpt: >-
  <p class="article-excerpt">
  CESNET is the first national research and education network in the world to deploy segment routing over IPv6 (SRv6) using the concept of micro-segments (uSID). SRv6 will contribute to the simplification of network architecture and processes, and thus to the efficient management and operation of the latest generation network called CESNET3.
  </p>
  <p class="article-excerpt">
  SRv6 makes it easy to route traffic through faster or less congested routes, for example, but also to tailor the passage of packets through the network infrastructure to the needs of individual users or applications. It can therefore also be used to improve the security of the network environment by user routing of packets through protection and cleaning elements, such as the DDoS Protector from CESNET.
