title: 'SRv6 uSID and IPM Roadshow in Bangkok, Thailand'
author: 'Cisco team'
technology: 'SRv6'
excerpt: 'After Dubai, Tokyo, NYC, and Rome, the SRv6 uSID roadshow got back to Asia to celebrate the many deployments in the region and provide an update on SRv6 uSID and IPM solutions.
The SRv6 uSID solution provides a unified solution across various network segments, outperforming legacy silo solutions. It allows to build stateless end-to-end programs encompassing overlay, underlay and service chaining requirements.
The IPM solution provides the scale required to monitor the network experience of all clients  (3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher scale than legacy solutions). It drastically reduces CAPEX and OPEX. It provides richer metrics (latency histograms). It correlates measurement with routing analytics. It provides a formidable opportunity for AI.'

After Dubai, Tokyo, NYC, and Rome, the SRv6 uSID roadshow got back to Asia to celebrate the many deployments in the region and provide an update on SRv6 uSID and IPM solutions.

The SRv6 uSID solution provides a unified solution across various network segments, outperforming legacy silo solutions. It allows to build stateless end-to-end programs encompassing overlay, underlay and service chaining requirements.

The IPM solution provides the scale required to monitor the network experience of all clients  (3 to 4 orders of magnitude higher scale than legacy solutions). It drastically reduces CAPEX and OPEX. It provides richer metrics (latency histograms). It correlates measurement with routing analytics. It provides a formidable opportunity for AI.

Attendees had the opportunity to listen to the deployment experience from Alibaba, Bell Canada, Rakuten, and Softbank. 

The Cisco SR team thanks our lead operators for sharing their deployment experience, our attendees, and the local team for their support.
