**Amit Dhamija of Rakuten** presents "Rakuten - SRv6 uSID with network slicing use cases".

Exploring the benefits of deploying SRv6 uSID, the application of slicing and key learnings.
SRv6 simplifies the Rakuten network while improving its effieciency.
Using native IPv6 forwarding, the SRv6 uSID architecture supports ultra scalability in 5G SA deployments.
A key advantage of SRv6 is its extensibility without boundaries, allowing it to be extended to the Mobile Network RAN and Core domains.
