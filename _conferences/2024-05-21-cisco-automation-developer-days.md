**Clarence Filsfils** of Cisco Systems presented "Integrated Performance Measurement" at [**Cisco Automation Developer Days 2024** (cisco.com)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/service-provider/events/nso-developer-days.html), May 2024 in Stockholm.

Integrated Performance Measurement (IPM) represents a paradigm shift in network performance monitoring, offering a staggering 1000x scale improvement over traditional solutions while eliminating the appliance costs. Providing detailed insights into the user experience through latency histograms and a comprehensive suite of metrics, IPM paints a complete picture of network performance that directly correlates with user satisfaction.

The cornerstone of IPM is its Routing Analytics capability, which continuously correlates measurement data with routing information to support smarter network assurance. This enables a wide range of applications from baselining and clustering to advanced post-mortem analysis and inference, setting new standards for network optimization and management.
