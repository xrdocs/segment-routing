excerpt: >-
  The networking industry is going through an incredibly dynamic time of change and opportunity. Global IP traffic will increase nearly threefold over the next five years and 127-fold from 2005 to 2021.  The number of devices connected to IP networks by 2021 will be three times higher than the global population. On top of that, the diversity of applications has never been greater, with each having its own set of requirements and hurdles.
  This unprecedented growth requires Service Providers to transform their networks, and Segment Routing is becoming one of the keys to successfully paving the way to that transformation.
