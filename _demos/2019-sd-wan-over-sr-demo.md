Jose Liste demonstrates Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) over SR. SD-WAN and SR enables a service provider to offer underlay transport SLAs for SD-WAN customers. Customers mark the packets with their desired QoS and transport treatment. SP leverages SR per-flow On-Demand Nexthop (ODN) and Automated Steering (AS) to provide the underlay transport SLAs according to the customer's marking.
