excerpt: >-
  Do you remember source routing, used in token ring bridging networks? If you're relatively new to networking, you may not know about it. In source routing, the hosts determine the path to take through the network and build a frame header that specifies the forwarding nodes that the frame should pass through as it goes from source to destination.
