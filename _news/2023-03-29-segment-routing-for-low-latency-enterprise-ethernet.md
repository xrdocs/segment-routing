technology: 'SRMPLS'
excerpt: >-
  To satisfy the need for low-latency, diverse Ethernet services on a global scale, Arelion has implemented segment routing based on the lowest latency paths across their multi-vendor network.
  <br/>
  Arelion created a low-latency routing plane using Flex-Algo with link-delay metrics. Combined with Topology Independent Loop-Free Alternate (TI-LFA) they can offer their customers resilient low-latency connectivity.
