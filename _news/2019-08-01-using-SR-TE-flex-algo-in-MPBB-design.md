excerpt: >-
  This whitepaper describes the drivers, use cases, and design of the multiplanar backbone.<br />
  
  Given stringent financial controls, flat CapEx and OpEx budgets, and being asked to do more with the same or less, 
  network operators are limited in their ability to create new services and new revenue streams.<br />
  
  The concept of a multiplanar design, or multiplanar backbone (MPBB), which this document introduces, 
  can be used to deliver the next generation of services and support as well as increase reliability and 
  performance over today’s current network designs.<br />
  
  The MPBB design leverages the flexibility and simplicity of SR-TE IGP Flex-Algo. 
  Read this document to find out how Flex-Algo helps realizing the MPBB goals.
