excerpt: >-
  Who would have bet on a SRv6 interoperability demonstration at SIGCOMM 2017 conference this summer?
  Very few of us actually… For those who are not familiar with the SIGCOMM 2017 conference, this is a highly respected conference where key networking innovations and orientations are being discussed every year by leading vendors, major web and service providers, and academic researchers.
