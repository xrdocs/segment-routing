**Alberto Donzelli** (Technical Solutions Architect, Cisco) presents "Introduction to Segment Routing" at Cisco Live Barcelona 2020

This session provides an overview of the segment routing technology and its use cases. This new routing paradigm provides high operational simplicity and maximum network scalability and flexibility. You will get an understanding of the basic concepts behind the technology and its wide applicability ranging from simple transport for MPLS services, disjoint routing, traffic engineering and its benefits in the context of software defined networking. Previous knowledge of IP routing and MPLS is required.
