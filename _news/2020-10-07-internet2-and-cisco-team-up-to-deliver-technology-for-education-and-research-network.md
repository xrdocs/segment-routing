excerpt: >-
  Internet2 announced a strategic alliance with Cisco to deliver next-generation capabilities and software solutions across the U.S. research and education (R&E) infrastructure that enables scientific collaboration at a global scale.<br />
  Internet2 will deploy Cisco’s latest 8200 series routing platform powered by Cisco Silicon One ASICs, running IOS® XR7 and Network Services Orchestration (NSO) software as part of the packet infrastructure upgrade to its national backbone.<br />
  A move to segment routing with multiprotocol label switching (SR-MPLS) and Ethernet virtual private network (EVPN) will allow researcher applications to eventually claim up to an entire 400G link for a particular application while other network uses are dynamically moved to other paths.
