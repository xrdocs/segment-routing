excerpt: The application steers its packets through an ordered list of instructions and realizes end-to-end policy without creating any per-flow state in the network.

    excerpt: >-
      Segment Routing provides complete control over the forwarding paths by combining simple network instructions. It does not require any additional protocol. Indeed in some cases it removes unnecessary protocols simplifying your network.
  - title: Scalable
    image_path: images/new-home/Scalable.svg
    excerpt: >-
      Segment routing does not require any path signaling. Hence, per-flow state only needs to be maintained at the ingress node of the SR domain increasing your network flexibility while reducing cost.
  - title: Seamless deployment
    image_path: images/new-home/Seamless-Deployment.svg
    excerpt: >-
      Segment Routing runs natively on an MPLS or IPv6 data plane. A simple software upgrade will enable your hardware to run it. Also, Segment Routing can coexist with your existing LDP network, making the migration painless.

  - title: Simplify your network
    excerpt: >-
      Removing protocols and making network operations easier means Segment Routing is your fast track to network simplification.
  - title: Make the network more robust
    excerpt: >-
      With Segment Routing, your network is more resilient. Whenever and wherever a node or a link fails in the network, connectivity is restored in under 50 milliseconds!
  - title: Squeeze more out of your network
    excerpt: >-
      Hyperscale cloud providers have learned that by dynamically rerouting traffic, they can reach an overall capacity utilization of 80 percent or more.
  - title: Release innovation
    excerpt: >-
      Segment Routing powers two vital network services:low-latency and disjointness.
  - title: Offer new levels of customer satisfaction
    excerpt: >-
      With an efficient network structure, you have a strong foundation on which to offer a best-in-class end-user experience.

      “Segment Routing is fundamental for today’s reality, which requires on-demand services as well as exponential bandwidth growth. Streamlining the IP protocols stack in order to provide a simplified service assurance support model for day-to-day is the key benefit.”

      “Micro-loops have always been a pain for networks by breaking fast-reroute or creating micro-congestions. Now, thanks to the Segment Routing building blocks, we have the technology to easily build loop free paths in the network in a simple way.”

      “It gives us network independence, we don’t need to write our proprietary agent for every box we want to buy, we get to use standard IGP to set up our connectivity instead of having to do that ourselves. Segment Routing lets you program only the edge. We don’t have the problem of tunnel setup synchronization; the network configures itself.”

      “Segment Routing architecture brings us many benefits – first, it can be easily deployed in our existing network infrastructure; second, the ability to have fine-grain control over how the network transports applications while being stateless meets our elasticity requirements. It helps us to deliver a better end-user experience.”
