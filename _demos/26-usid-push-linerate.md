## SRv6 ultra-scale - Imposition 26 SRv6 uSIDs at Linerate

**Rakuten**, **Bell Canada** and **Cisco Systems** are happy to report the successful validation of line rate insertion of 26 SRv6 uSIDs on the NCS 5700 Series platforms running Cisco IOS XR.

The NCS5700 Series line cards and routers are powered by Broadcom Jericho2 family NPUs, providing 400GigE interfaces to offer 4.8Tbps of interface bandwidth and 5.6Tbps to the fabric.

This report demonstrates the ultra-scale capability of the SRv6 solution. 26 is indeed 2 to 3 times better than the current MPLS deployed use-cases.

While reducing the number of layers (MPLS, VxLAN, and NSH are no longer needed), the SRv6 solution provides more power of service expression (Network Programming, Proposed Standard RFC 8986) and ultra-scale (as demonstrated in this report).

### *Demo Video*

{% include video id="2d6UAi0gUIM" provider="youtube" %}

### *Demo Setup*
The demo setup as illustrated in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> contains the ingress PE1 that will do the uSID imposition, connected to Ixia traffic generator ports via 400GbE interfaces.
 
<a id="fig1">
![]({{ 'images/2022-03-29-j2-26usid-demo/fig1.png' | relative_url }})
*Figure 1: Demo setup*
</a>

PE1 in this demo is a Cisco NCS-5508 chassis with NC57-18DD-SE linecard.

The simulated topology behind the Ixia receive port contains the egress PE26 and 24 nodes (numbered 2 to 25) that will be used as waypoints for the path from PE1 to egress PE26.

PE1 and PE26 are part of a VPN providing IPv4 connectivity.

PE26 advertises VPN route 10/8 towards PE1. The BGP nexthop is the loopback address of PE26, fcbb:bb00:26::1. With the service route, PE26 advertises the service SID fcbb:bb00:26:e002:: which is a combination of its uN SID and the uDT4 SID of this VRF.

PE26 also advertises a BGP color extended community 100 with the route, which identifies the SLA requested for this route. PE1 will use this color for its color-based Automated Steering into an SR Policy.

<br />
### *SR Policy on PE1*
The SR Policy on PE1 uses and explicit segment-list with 24 uN SIDs (Prefix-SIDs), specifying the path to traverse 24 SIDs before ending on the egress PE26. The configuration on PE1 of the SR Policy with the explicit segment-list is shown in <a href="#ex1">Example 1</a>. The SR Policy’s color 100 and endpoint fcbb:bb00:26::1 match the color and nexthop of the VPNv4 service route advertised by PE26.
Note: the configuration commands are subject to change.

### *BGP VPNv4 service route*
PE26 advertises the BGP VPNv4 route 10.0.0.0/8 to PE1. The route as received by PE1 is shown in <a href="#ex4">Example 4</a>.

The color 100 and nexthop fcbb:bb00:26::1 matches the color and nexthop of SR Policy POL1, therefore PE1 steers this route via this SR Policy’s Binding SID fcbb:bb00:1:e013::. This is shown in the output displayed in <a href="#ex4">Example 4</a>.

PE26 advertises the VPNv4 route with a uDT4 SID (behavior id=63) fcbb:bb00:26:e002::.

The output in <a href="#ex4">Example 4</a> shows that a Prefix-SID Attribute is attached to the route with an SRv6 L3 Service TLV  (`PSID-Type:L3`). This TLV carries an SRv6 SID Information sub-TLV that again carries an SRv6 SID Structure sub-sub-TLV (SSTLV in short).

To increase BGP Update packing efficiency, PE26 uses the “transposition” functionality in the SRv6 service SID advertisement (see draft-ietf-bess-srv6-services for details). Part of the service SID (fcbb:bb00:26::) is carried in the SRv6 L3 Service TLV, with the remaining part carried in the MPLS label field of the NLRI. The use if this transposition functionality is indicated in the SSTLV fields `Tpose-len:16, Tpose-offset:48`.

### *Traffic generator*
We are now ready to start sending the IPv4 traffic into ingress PE1. PE1 will impose the SID list of 26 uSIDs on the packets using an outer IPv6 header with SRH and forward these encapsulated packets to the receive port of the Ixia traffic generator, as illustrated in <a href="fig2">Figure 2</a>.
 
<a id="fig2">
![]({{ 'images/2022-03-29-j2-26usid-demo/fig2.png' | relative_url }})
*Figure 2: Screenshot of Ixia traffic statistics*
</a>

At the bottom of <a href="fig2">Figure 2</a>, a partial screenshot of the Ixia traffic generator is shown, showing the traffic statistics.
Loss % is zero, no packets are lost. The “Frames Delta” field shows how many transmitted packets are still in transit.

The Layer 1 receive rate “Rx L1 Rate (bps)” is slightly above 399 Gbps, which is about the maximum rate that can be sent on a 400GbE interface.

<br />
### *Packet Capture*
We capture some of the data packets as received by Ixia receive port and use Wireshark to display a packet. A wireshark screenshot is shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>.
 
<a id="fig3">
![]({{ 'images/2022-03-29-j2-26usid-demo/fig3.png' | relative_url }})
*Figure 3: Wireshark display of a captured packet*
</a>

The packet has an outer IPv6 header with Destination Address fcbb:bb00:2:3:4:5:6:7. This is a uSID container with six uSIDs, the first container as was also shown in the output of <a href="#ex3">Example 3</a>.

The packet contains an SR Routing Header (SRH) with four segments in the Segment List. These four segments are four uSID containers, three of which contain six uSIDs and one containing two uSIDs. Note that the segments in the SRH are encoded in reverse order: last one on top, first one on bottom.

With 6 uSIDs in the IPv6 Destination Address and 20 uSIDs (= 3 × 6 + 1 × 2) this makes a total of 26 uSIDs imposed on the packet.

<br />
### *Conclusion*
This report demonstrates the successful validation of line rate insertion of 26 uSID’s on the NCS 5700 Series platforms running Cisco IOS XR.

It demonstrates the ultra-scale capability of the SRv6 solution. 26 is indeed 2 to 3 times better than the current MPLS deployed use-cases.

While reducing the number of layers (MPLS, VxLAN, and NSH are no longer needed), the SRv6 solution provides more power of service expression (Network Programming, Proposed Standard RFC 8986) and ultra-scale.
